                         GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                           Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                         Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works. This license is intended to guarantee your
freedom to share and change all versions of a programâ€”to make sure it
remains free software for all its users. When we speak of free software,
we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are
designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of
free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you
receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the software and use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you are
informed that you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
rights that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or
can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' sake, the GPL explains that
there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed and be licensed as broadly as the original software.

                         TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

   This License refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
   The "Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
   License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensor" refers to
   the individual, individuals, or organization that distributes the
   Program under this License.

   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
   making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form
   of a work.

   "You" means the licensee, and "your" has a corresponding meaning.

1. Source Code.

   The Licensor must make the source code available to you. The
   Licensor must also make it clear that you can request the source
   code if it is not included in the distribution.

2. Basic Permissions.

   You are granted the rights to use, modify, and distribute copies of
   the Program. You may also charge a fee for these copies.

3. Copyleft.

   You must keep the same license if you modify the program and
   distribute it. This is known as the "copyleft" requirement.

4. License for Your Modifications.

   If you modify the program and distribute it, you must include a
   prominent notice stating that you have changed the Program.

5. No Warranty.

   There is no warranty for the program. If it doesn't work, you get no
   compensation or warranty.

6. Endorsement.

   This License does not grant you permission to use the trade names,
   trademarks, service marks, or other identifiers of the Licensor.

7. Acceptance.

   You accept this License if you distribute or modify the program.

8. Future Versions.

   You may choose to follow the terms and conditions of a later version
   of this License or the original version.

9. Translation.

   Translation of this License is permitted as long as you include a
   translation of the license that makes it clear that the license is
   an adaptation of the GNU GPL.

10. GNU GPL.
